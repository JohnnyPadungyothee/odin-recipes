    <h2>The French Fry's Cousin</h2>
    <p>Potato wedges are very similar to french fries as they are both finger foods made of potatoes and are primarily used as side dishes to accompany another dish. Potato wedges, however, are much "meatier" and keep more of the potato in comparison to the skinnier and crispier french fries.</p>
